# About this role:
This is a unique opportunity to join an exciting, well-funded startup as the first engineer on the team. We are looking for a talented engineer to help architect and define our platform from the ground up. The successful candidate will also help hire and lead the founding engineering team.

## Our mission:
We are an InsurTech start-up committed to creating innovative, customer-centric and transparent products & services to help pet owners keep their pet healthy and happy. 

Today, the Pet insurance Industry is broken, it’s heartless, bureaucratic, confusing and opaque. The customer experience is poor with cumbersome slow processes and non-holistic cover that does not meet the customer needs.  People expect more than just insurance: more value for money with a 360-degrees selection of value-added services beyond mere insurance, full transparency on policies they are taking out, and a seamless, digital-first, experience. Come build it with us.

## Our values:
- Be Candid and authentic
	- We bring our true self to work - who we wholly are!
    - We are transparent and are not afraid to share information with each others, 	good and bad news!

- Trust and care for each other
	- We trust each other to do the right thing
	- We are not afraid to make mistakes, and we ask for help when we need it
	- We encourage each other, when people struggle, we help them

- Do the right thing
	- We are fair to our customers and we care about the wellbeing of their pets
	- When facing difficult decisions we put ethics above profits 
	- We always act in the best interest of the company

- We are all owners and optimise for impact
	- We are always looking for the most impactful thing to work on
	- We take responsibility and we’re problem solvers - hold yourself and others accountable 
	- Nothing at <Name> is somebody else’s problem, we always jump in to help where needed

## You should apply if you:
- Are a highly autonomous and pragmatic individual passionate about solving ambiguous problems, building products and code craftsmanship.
- Love to learn and pass on your knowledge to others.
- Are excited about joining as the very first engineer in the team.
- Thrive from shipping early and often following modern practices like continuous delivery.
- Want to hire and lead a strong team of engineers.
- Have expert knowledge of at least one modern web-oriented language (Python, Ruby, Javascript, PHP etc.) and related web frameworks.
- Have a strong understanding of modern databases and at least one SQL dialect.
- Are comfortable architecturing and implementing high quality APIs following best practices.
- Have devops experience scaling and running cloud based  applications (e.g. AWS).
- Want to write clean, effective and easy to maintain code with proper documentation.
- Value testing and routinely test your code and the product you build.

## What you'll do:
- Collaborate with the co-founders in hiring plans and tech stack definition.
- Hire, ramp-up and lead back-end, web and mobile engineers.
- Collaborate closely with other engineers, designers, researchers, product managers to find end-to-end solutions for problems of our customers.
- Organise design and code reviews.
- Write clear, maintainable code that implements these solutions in new and existing backend services.

## What we offer:
- A competitive salary plus a generous stock options package.

- Flexible working hours and leave policy (28 days annual holidays - including bank holidays)
- Extra day off for your birthday.
- Some budget for personal growth and training.
